@par Overview
  - This is not an example project. This project is a bootloader for AW7698 EVK.
    The developer can refer this project to understand how
    to build a bootloader.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the EVK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the AW7698
      EVK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "AW7698_EVK_Users_Guide.pdf"
      in [sdk_root]/doc/board/aw7698_evk folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the AW7698 EVK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "Airoha IoT SDK for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
