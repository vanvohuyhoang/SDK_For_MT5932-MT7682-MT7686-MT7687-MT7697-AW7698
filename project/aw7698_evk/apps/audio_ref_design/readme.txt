@par Run the examples
  - The following example demonstrate the OPUS SW codec.
  - Example. OPUS_CLET OGG SW codec demo.
    - For a detailed description of the API, please refer to "OPUS_Codec_Application_Note",
      the file path is "prebuilt\middleware\third_party\audio\ogg_codec folder".
    - There are three CLI commands for the demo. Use the following commands to play or parse data.
      \code
      - opus 1 : Play OPUS data
      - opus 2 : Parse OGG from the buffer to the OPUS decoder
      - opus 3 : Parse PCM from the buffer to the OPUS encoder and check
      \endcode
