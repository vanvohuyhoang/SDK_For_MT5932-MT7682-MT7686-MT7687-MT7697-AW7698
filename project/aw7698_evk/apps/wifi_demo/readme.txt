  - Example project description
    - This project demonstrates the Wi-Fi connectivity and low power consumption 
      features of the 7698 EVK through the following:
      - How to use the Wi-Fi profile settings stored in the NVDM to initialize
        the Wi-Fi.
      - How to use the tickless feature to achieve low power consumption.
  - Application features
    - Act as a Wi-Fi station to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
    - Act as a Wi-Fi AP to accept connection to the 7698 EVK using a
      handheld device or a laptop computer.
    - Ping out or into the device.

@par Run the examples
  - Connect the board to a PC with a USB cable.
  - Build the example project and download the binary file to the 
    7698 EVK.
  - Reboot the EVK, the console will show "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate the EVK is booting up.
  - Use '?' and enter to query the available command line options.
    Note that the command line options are still under development and subject
    to change without notice.
  - The following three examples demonstrate the Wi-Fi station and Wi-Fi access
    point modes of the 7698 EVK.
  - Example 1. Wi-Fi station mode.
    - Find your Wi-Fi access point settings:
      Before connecting to a Wi-Fi access point, the following information
      needs to be collected:
      -# The SSID of your Wi-Fi access point.
      -# The authentication mode of your Wi-Fi access point.
          In general, the authentication mode is WPA PSK or WPA2 PSK.
          To change the mode, please refer to Table 1 for the list of supported
          authentication modes.
      -# The password of your Wi-Fi access point.
      -# The encryption mode of your Wi-Fi access point.
          In general, AES or TKIP is used.
          To change the mode, please refer to Table 2 for the list of supported
          encryption modes.
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to configure
      the 7698 EVK. The example code in main.c assumes either WPA PSK or
      WPA2 PSK is used for authentication, TKIP or AES for encryption, 'myhome'
      (length 6) for the SSID, and the password of the WPA or WPA2 is
      '12345678' (length 8).
      \code
        config write STA AuthMode 9
        config write STA EncrypType 8
        config write STA Ssid myhome
        config write STA SsidLen 6
        config write STA WpaPsk 12345678
        config write STA WpaPskLen 8
        config write common OpMode 1
      \endcode
    - Press the reset button on the 7698 EVK to restart the system.
    - Boot up with the new configuration.
      If everything is correct, similar messages will be shown in the console
      to notify your EVK has received an IP address.
      \code
        DHCP got IP:10.10.10.101
      \endcode
    - PING from the 7698 EVK.
      If the IP address is fetched and the network is operating, the 
      7698 can ping other devices on the network with the following
      command in the console.
      \code
      ping 10.10.10.254 3 64
      The ping stops after sending three packets to 10.10.10.254.
      The ping usage is: ping <ip address> <times> <ping packet length>
      \endcode
    - Wi-Fi configuration options for AuthMode and EncrypType.

      Table 2. Supported EncrypType(s)
      \endcode
  - Example 2. Wi-Fi access point mode.
    - Provide the Wi-Fi access point settings:
      - SSID
      - Authentication Mode
      - Encryption Type
      - Password
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the 7698 EVK. This example assumes WPA2 PSK is used for
      authentication, AES for encryption, 'iot_ap' (length 6) for the SSID,
      and the password of the WPA2 is '87654321' (length 8).
        \code
        config write AP Ssid iot_ap
        config write AP SsidLen 6 
        config write AP AuthMode 7
        config write AP EncrypType 6
        config write AP WpaPsk 87654321
        config write AP WpaPskLen 8
        config write common OpMode 2
        \endcode
    - Press the reset button on the 7698 EVK to restart the system.
    - Use a handheld device or a laptop computer to connect to the access point
      'iot_ap'. In the console, the IP address assigned to the the handheld device
      or laptop is:
        \code
        [DHCPD:DBG]lease_ip:10.10.10.2
        \endcode
