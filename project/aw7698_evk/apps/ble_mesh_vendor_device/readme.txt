@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This is a reference application to show the Bluetooth mesh vendor device feature of the AW7698 EVK
      through the following:
      - How to use the Bluetooth mesh device functions.
  - Application features
    - Act as a Bluetooth low-energy (LE) device with mesh features. All Bluetooth Mesh Command Line
      Interface (CLI) commands are supported in this project.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - Airoha AW7698 EVK
  - EVK switches and pin configuration
    - J36 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, SPI master chip select 0, SPI
      master, and UART1 RX/TX.
    - J35 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RX/TX, UART1 RTS/CTS, SPI
      master chip select 1, IR TX, and IR RX.
    - J34 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RTS/CTS, I2S, SPI slave,
      and I2C0.
    - J33 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, I2C0, and ADC0~3.
    - J32 provides the pins for GND, 5V, 3.3V, and the reset pin.
    - J25 sets the EVK to either Flash Normal mode or Flash Recovery mode. To
      update the firmware on the AW7698 EVK:
      - Set the Jumper J25 to FLASH Recovery mode; Jumpers J23, J26, J27,
        and J30 must be on.
      - In this mode, if the power is on, the board loads the ROM code and
        starts the ATE Daemon or Firmware Upgrade Daemon according to the
        MT76x7 Flash Tool's behavior on the PC. To run the project on the
        AW7698 EVK:
      - Set the Jumper J25 off to switch to FLASH Normal mode; Jumpers
        J23, J26, J27, and J30 must be on.
      - In this mode, if the power is on, the board loads firmware from
        the flash and reboots.
    - There are three buttons on the board:
      - RST - Reset
      - EINT - External interrupt
      - RTC_INT - RTC interrupt
  - Environment configuration
    - A serial tool is required, such as TeraTerm for UART logging.
    - COM port settings -baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none, and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh aw7698_evk
    ble_mesh_vendor_device" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to the
    AW7698 development board.
  - Reboot the EVK. The console shows the "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate that the EVK is booting up.
  - Use '?' and ENTER to query the available command line options. Note that
    the command line options are still under development and subject to
    change without notice.
  - Reference applications run and the AW7698 EVK can join the Bluetooth LE mesh that is enabled nearby.
  - Example 1. Using the BLE mesh feature
    - This example creates a BLE mesh device with six mesh elements. There are five types of models that are covered in these
      elements: configuration server model; health server model; 
      generic on/off server model; vendor server model; and lighting server model.
      The structure of this vendor device is shown below:
      - It supports Relay feature, Proxy feature and Friend feature.
      - It has six elements and each element has different models, as shown below:
        - Element 0 includes three SIG models: "Configuration Server"; "Health 
          Server"; "Generic OnOff Server"; and one vendor model with ID 0x002A.
        - Element 1 includes nine SIG models: "Generic Level Server"; "Generic OnOff 
          Server"; "Generic Default Transition Time Server"; "Generic Power OnOff 
          Server"; "Generic Power OnOff Setup Server"; "Light Lightness Server"; "Light 
          Ligntness Setup Server"; "Light CTL Server"; and "Light CTL Setup Server". 
        - Element 2 includes two SIG models: "Generic OnOff Server"; and "Light CTL Temperature Server".  
        - Element 3 includes nine SIG models: "Generic Level Server"; "Generic OnOff 
          Server"; "Generic Default Transition Time Server"; "Generic Power OnOff 
          Server"; "Generic Power OnOff Setup Server"; "Light Lightness Server"; "Light 
          Ligntness Setup Server"; "Light HSL Server"; and "Light HSL Setup Server".
        - Element 5 includes two SIG models: "Generic OnOff Server"; and "Light HSL HUE Server".  
        - Element 5 includes two SIG models: "Generic OnOff Server"; and "Light HSL Saturation Server".  
      - Element 0 is addressed using the first unicast address assigned to the node during provisioning. 
        Other elements are addressed using the subsequent addresses. For example, if the unicast of the node is 0004, 
        element 0 is addressed 0004, and element 1 is addressed 0005.  
    - The mesh feature is enabled when Bluetooth successfully powers on.
      A similar log is written to the output:
      \code
      [T: xxxx M: mesh_app C: info F: bt_mesh_app_event_callback L: 272]: BLE_MESH_EVT_INIT_DONE
      \endcode
    - When this device is successfully added to a mesh network.
      A similar log is written to the output:
      \code
      [T: xxxx M: mesh_app C: info F: bt_mesh_app_event_callback L: 287]: BLE_MESH_EVT_PROV_DONE
      \endcode
    - If the device receives a message from a different device using the same mesh network and application key, 
      a similar log is written to the output:
      \code
      Receive a SIG message in which xxxx is the SIG message id.
      [Mesh]rece SigMsg[xxxx]
      If the SIG message is to turn on/off LED on this device.
      [Mesh]led is on or [Mesh]led is off
      Receive a vendor message in which xx is the company id and xxxx is the vendor message id.
      [Mesh]rece VenrodMsg[xx:xxxx]      
      \endcode
    - To delete the mesh data, use the command "mesh delete". It takes effect after rebooting again.
