 * This section introduces the Cross Core Notification Interface(CCNI) HAL APIs including terms and acronyms, details on how to use this driver, supported features, enums, structures and functions.
 * Every CCNI event is assigned to a specific user, the event handler routine is predefined. The ccni driver will be initialized at system initiation stage.

 *
 * @section HAL_CCNI_Driver_Usage_Chapter  How to use this driver
 *
 * - How to configure a CCNI event \n
 *   - It looks at bits 0 to 31 as events 0 to 31, keeps events 0 to 7 used with a message and events 8 to 31 used without a message.\n
 *
 *   - We strongly advise that you do not change the default configuration.\n
 *      (A) There are some events without a message which had been used as system default.\n
 *      (B) There are events with a message which uses reserved memeory.\n
 *
 * - How to define an event \n
 *   The CCNI module had 32 * 12 events. The driver defines a special name for every event in hal_ccni_config.h for easy use.\n
 *
 *  - Step 1: Decide to use an event with or without a message.\n
 *
 *  - Step 2: Find an event that is not used.\n
 *      (A) Check the event usage status in \\mcu\\driver\\chip\\ab155x\\inc\\hal_ccni_config.h. The event in default status can be used.\n
 *      (B) Check the ccni_*_to_*_function_table[] in hal_ccni_config.c; The event is not used if the isr is default_isr.\n
 *           For example, if you want to apply an event for CM4 to DSP0, please check ccni_cm4_to_dsp0_function_table[] to find an unused event.\n
 *      (C) If you want an event with a message, please select an event within event 0 to 7;\n
 *      (D) If you want an event without a message, please select an event within event 8 to 31.\n
 *
 *  - Step 3: Replace the event name in \\mcu\\driver\\chip\\ab155x\\inc\\hal_ccni_config.h.\n
 *    We strongly advise that you use a name which implies the event function.
 *    @code
 *    //define EVENT 8 for exception from DSP0 to CM4
      #define IRQGEN_DSP0_TO_CM4_EXCEPTION (HAL_CCNI_EVENT8|CCNI_EVENT_SRC_DSP0|CCNI_EVENT_DST_CM4)
 *    @endcode

 * - Step 4: Implement isr handler.\n
 *    @code
 *    //sample code for isr handler
 *    void user_event_handler_routine(hal_ccni_event_t event, void *msg)
 *    {
 *        uint32_t *pMsg = msg;
 *        hal_ccni_status_t status;
 *        //mask event first
 *        status = hal_ccni_mask_event(event);
 *        // the msg points to the message address if the event is with message. Otherwise, the msg is equal to NULL.
 *        if( pMsg != NULL) {
 *            uint32_t address;
 *            //Suppose CM4 received an EVENT from DSP0 with sharing memory and the memory address is in pMsg[0]. \n
 *            //Receiver should do memory address remap by hal_memview_infrasys_to_cm4(), otherwise it can not get right data.
 *            hal_memview_infrasys_to_cm4(pMsg[0]);
 *            log_hal_info("pMsg[0] = %x, pMsg[1] = %x \r\n", pMsg[0],pMsg[1]);
 *        }
 *
 *        //user deal with the event!
 *
 *        //If the event is managed here, please clear and unmask the event when it is complete
 *        //or the event will be managed at a thread level. Please clear and unmask the event when it is complete.
 *        //Otherwise, it cannot receive the event anymore.
 *        status = hal_ccni_clear_event(event);  // clear the event.
 *        status = hal_ccni_unmask_event(event); // unmask the event.
 *    }
 *    @endcode
 *
 * - Step 5: Register the isr handler to ccni_*_to_*_function_table[] in \\mcu\\driver\\chip\\ab155x\\inc\\hal_ccni_config.h. \n
 *
 * - Use the CCNI driver to send an event without a message to the other core.\n
 *
 *   - Step 1. Predefine the CCNI event and event handler routine in the source code.\n
 *
 *   - Step 2. Call #hal_ccni_set_event() to trigger an event.\n
 *
 *   - Step 3. Should check the return value, and do error handling if return value is not #HAL_CCNI_STATUS_OK. \n
 * - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       //CM4 send an event IRQGEN_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT9 to DSP0.
 *       uint32_t status;
 *       hal_ccni_event_t event = IRQGEN_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT9;
 *       // the second parameter should be NULL for event without message.
 *       ret = hal_ccni_set_event(event, NULL);
 *       if (HAL_CCNI_STATUS_OK != ret) {
 *           // Error handler;
 *       }
 *
 *    @endcode
 *
 * - Using the CCNI driver to send an event with a message to other core.\n
 *    @code
 *       //CM4 send an event CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT1 to DSP0 with const value in message.
 *       uint32_t status;
         //CM4 send event CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT1 to DSP0
 *       hal_ccni_event_t event = CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT1;
 *       uint32_t msg_array[2];
 *       //the destination core will receive the next 8-byte message.
 *       msg_array[0] = 0x80;
 *       msg_array[1] = 0xa5;
 *       //the second parameter should not be NULL.
 *       ret = hal_ccni_set_event(event, msg_array);
 *       if (HAL_CCNI_STATUS_OK !=  ret) {
 *           //Error handler;
 *       }
 *
 *       //CM4 send an event CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT2 to DSP0 and notify send 128 Bytes data with sharing memory.
 *       uint32_t status;
 *       uint32_t sharing_memory_address;
 *       //CM4 send event CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT2 to DSP0
 *       hal_ccni_event_t event = CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT2;
 *       uint32_t msg_array[2];
 *       //the destination core will receive the next 8-byte message.
 *       sharing_memory_address = 0xabc;  // the memory 0xabc should be defined with #ATTR_SHARE_RWDATA.
 *       //Please use hal_memview_cm4_to_infrasys() to do address remap.
 *       msg_array[0] = hal_memview_cm4_to_infrasys(sharing_memory_address);
 *       //Please mind the the receiver should call hal_memview_dsp0_to_infrasys(msg_array[0]) to remap the address, otherwise the receiver can not get the right data.
 *       msg_array[1] = 0x80;
 *       //the second parameter should not be NULL.
 *       ret = hal_ccni_set_event(event, msg_array);
 *       if (HAL_CCNI_STATUS_OK != ret) {
 *           //Error handler;
 *       }
 * 
 *       // It is an example when got HAL_CCNI_STATUS_BUSY at #hal_ccni_set_event;
 *       uint32_t status;
 *       uint32_t count;
 *       do{
 *           status = hal_ccni_set_event(CCNI_CM4_TO_DSP0_EVENT11, NULL);
 *           if(status == HAL_CCNI_STATUS_BUSY) {
 *               hal_gpt_delay_ms(1);
 *               count++;
 *           }
 *           if (count > 10) {
