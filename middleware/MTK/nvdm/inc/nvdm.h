 * @{
 * This section introduces the NVDM APIs including terms and acronyms,
 * supported features, software architecture, details on how to use the NVDM, enums, structures, typedefs and functions.
 *
 * @section NVDM_Terms_Chapter Terms and acronyms
 *

 * |\b NVDM             | Non-volatile Data Management is a middleware used to store user data. |
 *
 * @section NVDM_Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - \b Support \b retaining \b data \b after \b power \b is \b off. \n
 *   NVDM stores user data in a flash memory, so the data is preserved even after the power is off. \n
 * - \b Support \b grouping \b data \b items. \n
 *   The NVDM stores data items based on group names.
 *   The user can define different data items with different group names.
 *   This enables the data item classification and keeps them in order.
 *
 * @section NVDM_APIs_Usage_Chapter How to use the NVDM APIs
 *
 * - To use the NVDM services follow the steps, as shown below. \n
 *  - Step 1. Call #nvdm_init() to initialize the NVDM module.
 *  - Step 2. Call #nvdm_write_data_item() to write or update data item to the flash.
 *  - Step 3. Call #nvdm_read_data_item() to read data item from the flash.
 *  - Step 4. Call #nvdm_query_begin() to start the query request.
 *  - Step 5. Call #nvdm_query_next_group_name() to query the next available data item group.
 *  - Step 6. Call #nvdm_query_next_data_item_name() to query the next available data item from the group queried in Step 5.
 *  - Step 7. Call #nvdm_query_end() to end the query.
 *  - Step 8. Call #nvdm_delete_data_item() to delete a specific data item in flash.
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *       #define STA_IPADDR_DEFAULT_VALUE "192.168.0.1"
 *
 *       void nvdm_application(void)
 *       {
 *           nvdm_status_t status;
 *           uint32_t size;
 *           uint8_t buffer[64] = STA_IPADDR_DEFAULT_VALUE;
 *           char group_name[64];
 *           char data_item_name[64];
 *
 *           status = nvdm_init();
 *           if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               //Error handler;
 *           }
 *
 *           status = nvdm_write_data_item("STA", "IpAddr", NVDM_DATA_ITEM_TYPE_STRING, buffer, sizeof(STA_IPADDR_DEFAULT_VALUE));
 *           if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               //Error handler;
 *           }
 *
 *           size = sizeof(buffer);
 *           status = nvdm_read_data_item("STA", "IpAddr", buffer, &size);
 *           if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               //Error handler;
 *           }
 *
 *           status = nvdm_query_begin();
 *           if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               //Error handler;
 *           }
 *           while (nvdm_query_next_group_name(group_name) == NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               while (nvdm_query_next_data_item_name(data_item_name) == NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *                   size = sizeof(buffer);
 *                   status = nvdm_read_data_item(group_name, data_item_name, buffer, &size);
 *                   if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *                       //Error handler;
 *                   }
 *                   //Handle the value;
 *               }
 *           }
 *           status = nvdm_query_end();
 *           if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               //Error handler;
 *           }
 *
 *           status = nvdm_delete_data_item(group_name, data_item_name);
 *           if (status != NVDM_STATUS_OK) {
 *               //Error handler;
 *           }
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *
 * - NVDM support allows the user to manage data items (i.e. read, write, and delete) and query APIs.
 *   These operations are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if an operation is occurring, the next operation
 *   is prevented from starting until the first operation is complete.
 *
 * @section NVDM_Region_Adjust_Chapter How to adjust the NVDM region
 *
 * - There is a special flash region assigned to the NVDM to store user defined data.
 * For more information on the NVDM memory layout, please refer to the Memory Layout Developer's Guide.
 * - To modify start address and size of the NVDM region, apply the following steps.
 *  - Step 1. Follow chapters "Memory layout adjustment with a linker script" and
 *     "Memory layout adjustment with a scatter file" in Memory Layout Developer's Guide
 *     to modify the start address and size of the NVDM.
 *  - Step 2. Modify flash_map.h or memory_map.h header files under /project/\<board\>/apps/\<project\>/inc/ according to the adjustments in Step 1.
 *   - For 7687 and 7697, user needs to modify flash_map.h under /project/\<board\>/apps/\<project\>/inc/.
 *      Modify the CM4_FLASH_USR_CONF_ADDR to adjust the start address of the NVDM region.
 *      Modify the FLASH_USR_CONF_SIZE to adjust the size of the NVDM region.
 *   - For other chips, modify the memory_map.h header file under /project/\<board\>/apps/\<project\>/inc/.
 *      Modify the ROM_NVDM_BASE to adjust the start address of the NVDM region.
 *      Modify the ROM_NVDM_LENGTH to adjust the size of the NVDM region.
