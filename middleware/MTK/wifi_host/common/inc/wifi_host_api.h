* This section introduces the Wi-Fi host APIs, including terms and acronyms, Wi-Fi function groups, enumerations, structures, and functions. 
* It shows how to perform some of the Wi-Fi operations with the platforms that utilize the host chip (MT2523) and the Wi-Fi chip (MT5932).
*
* Terms                         |Details                                                                 |
* ------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
* \b STA                        | In station (STA) mode, the device operates as a client that connects to a Wi-Fi access point.|
* \b AP                         | In Access Point (AP) mode, other devices can connect to the Wi-Fi access point.|
* \b WPS                        | Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a network security standard for creating a secure wireless home network. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup">introduction to WPS in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b PIN                        | Personal identification number (PIN) is a WPS method in which the password for the device is shown on the actually device, usually as a sticker. This PIN must then be keyed in when the device joins the network, usually the network's AP. Alternately, a PIN provided by the AP can be entered into the new device. This method is the mandatory baseline mode and everything must support it. The Wi-Fi direct specification supersedes this requirement by stating that all devices with a keypad or display must support the PIN method.|
* \b PBC                        | Push button (PBC) is a method of WPS. For more information, please refer to <a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup">introduction to PBC in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b RSSI                       | Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication">introduction to RSSI in Wikipedia</a>. |
* \b Beacon                     | Beacon frame is one of the management frames in IEEE 802.11 based WLANs.|
* \b WPA                        | Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a wireless encryption standard. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">introduction to WPA in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b WPS                        | Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a network security standard. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup">introduction to WPS in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b WEP                        | Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a wireless network security standard. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">introduction to WEP in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b WOW                        | Wake on Wireless (WOW) is a technology that allows remote wake-up of workstations from a standby power state to facilitate device management. |
* \b TKIP                       | Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is an algorithm used to secure wireless computer networks. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol">introduction to TKIP in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b AES                        | Advanced Encryption Standard process (AES) is a 'symmetric block cipher' for encrypting texts which can be decrypted with the original encryption key. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">introduction to AES in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b BSS                        | The basic service set (BSS) provides the basic building-block of an 802.11 wireless LAN. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29">introduction to 802.11 network in Wikipedia</a>.|
* \b IBSS                       | With 802.11, you can set up an ad hoc network of client devices without a controlling access point. The result is called an Independent BSS (IBSS). For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_%28802.11_network%29">introduction to 802.11 network in Wikipedia</a>.|
