* @note To get the MAC address, follow these steps:
*       1. Read eFuse from address 0x00, take bytes 4 to 9 as the STA MAC address and generate AP address from it by increasing the last byte by 1.
*       2. If NVDM is enabled, read NVDM from group "STA" and key "MacAddr" for STA MAC address and from group "AP" and key "MacAddr" for AP MAC address.
*          If the MAC address is retrieved successfully in Step 1, skip Step 2.
*          If no information is set in eFuse and NVDM, this function will return an error and consequently the Wi-Fi driver initialization will possibly fail, too.
