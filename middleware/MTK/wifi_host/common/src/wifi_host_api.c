/**
* @brief This function starts Wi-Fi Scanning.
*
* @param[in] ssid specifies the SSID to be included in the probe request packet for scanning the hidden AP. If the SSID is NULL, the SSID field in probe request packet will be NULL.
* @param[in] ssid_length specifies the length of the SSID.
* @param[in] bssid specifies the BSSID of the AP to be scanned. If the BSSID is specified, the unicast probe request is sent. If the BSSID is NULL, then the broadcast probe request is sent.
* @param[in] scan_mode is the scan mode that can be either a full scan or a partial scan.
*
* Value                         |Definition                                                              |

* \b 1                          | Partial, it's expected to be used in the SoftAP mode and keep stations online.|
*
* In the partial scan mode, the scanning is performed as follows.
* If the AP is currently on channel 5, it jumps to channels (1, 2),
* and then back to channel 5. After that it scans the channels (3, 4).
* The number of channels it scans each time is specified in the implementation.
* @param[in] scan_option selects scan options based on one of the following: active scan, passive scan or force active scan.
*
* Value                         |Definition                                                              |
* ------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
* \b 0                          | Active scan, (Passive in regulatory channels). The channels that will be scanned are decided by the product's country and region. A probe request will be sent to each of these channels.|
* \b 1                          | Passive in all channels. Receives and processes the beacon. No probe request is sent.|
* \b 2                          | Force active (active in all channels). Forced to active scan in all channels. A probe request will be sent to each of these channels.|
*
*
* @return  >=0 the operation completed successfully, <0 the operation failed.
*
* @note 1. No matter what the SSID and BSSID parameters are, the device will receive all beacon and probe response packets over the air, \n
* and record the result into ap_list buffer registered by #wifi_host_connection_scan_init().
* @note 2. The station mode supports only the full scan mode.
* @note 3. The AP/repeater/p2p GO mode supports only the partial scan mode.
