 * The Headset Profile (HSP) defines the proctocals and procedures that are used by devices requiring
 * a full-duplex audio connection combined with minimal device control command. The headsets can be wirelessly
 * connected for the purpose of acting as the devices's audio input and output mechanism, providing full-duplex audio.
 * The following roles are defined for this profile.
 * Audio Gateway (AG). A device that acts as a gateway of the audio, both for input and output. Typical devices acting as AGs are cellular phones.
 * Headset (HS). A device that acts as the AG's remote audio input and output.
 * - Supported profile version. 1.2
 * - Supported role.Headset.
 * - Supported features:
 *  - Incoming audio connection.
 *  - Outgoing audio connection.
 *  - Audio connection transfer.
 *  - Remote audio volume control.

 *
 * @section bt_hsp_api_usage How to use this module
 * This section presents the HSP connection handle and the method for sending commands to the remote device.
 * -1. (Mandatory) The AG initiates a connection to the HS, as shown in the figure titled as "HSP connection establishment message sequence" in the Bluetooth developer's guide under the [sdk_root]/doc folder.
 *   - Step 1. If a remote AG initiates a connection to the HS, the #BT_HSP_CONNECT_IND event notifies the function #bt_app_event_callback().
 *   - Step 2. Call the function #bt_hsp_connect_response() to accept or reject this connection request from the remote AG.
 *   - Step 3. The #BT_HSP_CONNECT_CNF event notifies the function #bt_app_event_callback() whether the HSP successfully connected.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t mgs, bt_status_t status, void *buff)
 *       {
 *           switch (event_id)
 *           {
 *              case BT_HSP_CONNECT_IND: {
 *                  bt_hsp_connect_ind_t *re_ind = (bt_hsp_connect_ind_t *)buff;
 *                  bt_hsp_connect_response(re_ind->handle,true);
 *                  break;
 *              }
 *              case BT_HSP_CONNECT_CNF: {
 *                  bt_hsp_connect_cnf_t* conn_cnf_p = (bt_spp_connect_cnf_t*) buff;
 *                  break;
 *              }
 *              default:
 *                  break;
 *            }
 *        }
 *    @endcode
 * - 2. (Mandatory) The HS initiates a connection to the AG, as shown in figure titled as "HSP connection establishment message sequence" in the Bluetooth developer's guide under the [sdk_root]/doc folder.
 *   - Step 1. Call the function #bt_hsp_connect() to initiate a connection to a remote AG.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       ret = bt_hsp_connect(&handle, &addr);
 *    @endcode
 *   Step 2. The #BT_HSP_CONNECT_CNF event notifies the function #bt_app_event_callback() if the device is connected successfully or not.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t mgs, bt_status_t status, void *buff)
 *       {
 *           switch (event_id)
 *           {
 *              case BT_HSP_CONNECT_CNF: {
 *                  bt_hsp_connect_cnf_t* conn_cnf_p = (bt_hsp_connect_cnf_t*) buff;
 *                  break;
 *              }
 *              default:
 *                  break;
 *            }
 *        }
 *    @endcode
 *  - 3. (Optional) When the #BT_HSP_CONNECT_CNF event is received, call the API #bt_hsp_send_command() to send a command for a user action, such as release a call by 'AT+CKPD=200'.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       ret = bt_hsp_send_command(handle, (const char*)"AT+CKPD=200");
 *    @endcode
 *  - 4. (Mandatory) Activate the audio link when the #BT_HSP_AUDIO_CONNECT_IND event is received. The application must activate the audio link status, as shown in the figure titled as "Incoming audio connection establishment message sequence" in the Bluetooth developer's guide under the [sdk_root]/doc folder.
 *   Step 1. 
 *  Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       ret = bt_hsp_set_audio_status(handle, BT_HSP_AUDIO_STATUS_ACTIVE);
 *    @endcode
 *   Step 2. The event #BT_HSP_AUDIO_STATUS_CHANGE_IND captured by #bt_app_event_callback() indicates the audio link status changed.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t mgs, bt_status_t status, void *buff)
 *       {
 *           switch (event_id) {
 *               case BT_HSP_AUDIO_STATUS_CHANGE_IND: {
 *                  bt_hsp_audio_connected_ind_t *status_changed = (bt_hsp_audio_connected_ind_t *)buf;
 *                  break;
 *               }
 *               default:
 *                  break;
 *           }
 *        }
 *    @endcode
 *  - 5. (Mandatory) Disconnect the HSP connection, as shown in the figure titled as "HSP connection release message sequence" in the Bluetooth developer's guide under the [sdk_root]/doc folder.
 *   - Sample code:
 *        Disconnect the HSP connection by passing the connection handle.
 *        The event #BT_HSP_DISCONNECT_IND captured by #bt_app_event_callback() indicates the HSP has disconnected.
 *    @code
 *       ret = bt_hsp_disconnect(handle);
 *    @endcode
