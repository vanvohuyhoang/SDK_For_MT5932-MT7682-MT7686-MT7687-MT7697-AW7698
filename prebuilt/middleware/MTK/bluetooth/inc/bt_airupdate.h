 * @section bt_airupdate_api_usage How to use this module
 * This section presents the Airupdadte connection handle and a method to inframtion packet.
 *  - 1. Mandatory, implement #bt_app_event_callback() to handle the Airupdate events, such as connect, RX indication and more.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       bt_airupdate_data_received_ind_t saved_data = {0};
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t msg_type, bt_status_t status, void *data)
 *       {
 *          switch (msg_type)
 *          {
 *              case BT_AIRUPDATE_CONNECTED_IND:
 *              {
 *                  bt_airupdate_connected_ind_t *connected = (bt_airupdate_connected_ind_t *)data;
 *                  // Airupdate link connected.
 *                  // Records the connected information(handle, remote address).
 *                  break;
 *              }
 *              case BT_AIRUPDATE_DISCONNECTED_IND:
 *              {
 *                  bt_airupdate_disconnected_ind_t *connected = (bt_airupdate_disconnected_ind_t *)data;
 *                  // Airupdate link disconnected.
 *                  // Records the disconnected information(handle, reason).
 *                  break;
 *              }
 *              case BT_AIRUPDATE_DATA_RECIEVED_IND:
 *              {
 *                   bt_airupdate_data_received_ind_t* data_ind_p = (bt_airupdate_data_received_ind_t*) buff;
 *                   bt_airupdate_hold_data(data_ind_p->packet);
  *                  saved_data.packet = data_ind_p->packet;
 *                   saved_data.packet_length = data_ind_p->packet_length;
